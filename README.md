Scripts to install latest version of Podman v4 on Ubuntu Jammy

The installation of Podman v4 is awkward...
We are told that the Kubic repositories are no longer supported
https://podman.io/blogs/2022/04/05/ubuntu-2204-lts-kubic.html

On Ubuntu Jammy the version in the archive is v3

So in practise, one needs to compile and install from source.

Only Podman ROOTLESS is supported here
